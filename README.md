ðŸš€ `RoCt` (**Ro**cket calculations using **C**an**t**era), pronounced "rocket" 
(rockâ€¢et, or /ËˆÉ¹É‘kÉªt/), is a Python software package that performs calculations related 
to rocket engines. RoCt uses the [Cantera](https://cantera.org/) library to handle 
thermodynamics and chemical equilibrium, and is meant to be a modern alternative to
the classic NASA [CEA](https://cearun.grc.nasa.gov/cea/ceaHome.htm) program.
